Time Box App
Description
The Time Box app is designed to improve work efficiency and health for work-from-home employees, entrepreneurs, freelancers, and students. By encouraging regular breaks and physical activity, this app aims to enhance productivity and reduce health issues associated with prolonged sitting and screen time.

Features:
Work and Rest Cycles: The app implements a structured schedule of 50 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute rest and a 5-minute compulsory walk. This cycle helps maintain high work ethic and efficiency while preventing back pain and vision problems.

Time Boxing: Organize your tasks with a dedicated to-do list. The app allows you to prioritize tasks into 'Important Tasks' and 'Overall Tasks,' helping you focus on what matters most.

User-Specific To-Dos: Each user can log in using their Google account, ensuring that only they can access and manage their personal to-dos.

With the Time Box app, you can achieve better work habits and a healthier lifestyle, making your work sessions more productive and balanced.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
